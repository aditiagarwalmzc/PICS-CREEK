# PICS-CREEK
Pics Creek is an online photo editor that lets user add basic filters to an image, rotate it, flip it, invert the colours to the opposite ones and even bring the image back to the original one.

The colours on the Home Page signify the **Filters** feature. The two women facing backwards to each other denotes the **Flip** feature. Their hand gestures signify the **Rotate** feature and the colour contrast of the two women indicates the **Invert Colours** feature.

The Home Page:

Here's how the editor looks after uploading the image:

After adding and adjusting Filters:

One click on the Rotate button rotates the image by 90°. The image after clicking on Rotate twice (i.e. rotating the image by 180°):

The Flipped version:

After inverting the colours:

And my editing skills are clearly awful, so let's bring the image back to it's original form.
